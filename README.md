# blueshift_anchor_vault

This is the vault exercise by blueshift after completing introductory theory of anchor. 

A vault allows users to securely store their assets. A vault is a fundamental building block in DeFi that, at its core, allows users to securely store their assets (lamports in this case) that only that same user can withdraw later.

Here, I have built a simple lamport vault that demonstrates how to work with basic accounts, Program Derived Addresses (PDAs), and Cross-Program Invocation (CPI).
